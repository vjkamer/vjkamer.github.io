        <p>
          Iâ€™m a Kazakh living in Prague, <strong>Frontend Developer</strong>,
          driven by curiosity, I love to develop great websites, always seeking
          to get my hands dirty with a new project.
        </p>
        <p>
          I usually work in pair with designers to translate their mockups into
          real websites.
        </p>
        <p>
          While developing I am trying to utilise time proofed methodologies and
          best practices, that's why I am using <strong>BEM methodology</strong>{" "}
          , <strong>Bootstrap grid system</strong>,{" "}
          <strong>Webpack bundling tool</strong> and many more.
        </p>
      </div>
    );
